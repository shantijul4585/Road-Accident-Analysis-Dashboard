# Road-Accident-Analysis-Dashboard
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to explore and analyze road accident data using Microsoft Excel, focusing on key dimensions such as casualty severity, vehicle types, road and surface conditions, light conditions, and geographic locations. Through PivotTables and interactive visualizations, this dashboard provides a clear and dynamic overview of accident trends, highlighting critical risk factors and helping stakeholders understand where and how most accidents occur. The goal is to support data-driven decision-making for improving road safety and reducing accident impacts.
