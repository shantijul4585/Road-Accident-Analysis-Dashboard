# Road-Accident-Analysis-Dashboard
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to explore and analyze road accident data using Microsoft Excel, focusing on key dimensions such as casualty severity, vehicle types, road and surface conditions, light conditions, and geographic locations. Through PivotTables and interactive visualizations, this dashboard provides a clear and dynamic overview of accident trends, highlighting critical risk factors and helping stakeholders understand where and how most accidents occur. The goal is to support data-driven decision-making for improving road safety and reducing accident impacts.

## Dataset Used 
- <a href="https://github.com/shantijul4585/Road-Accident-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/master/Road-Accident-Analysis-Dashboard.xlsx"><Dataset</a>

## Process
- Imported road accident dataset containing 417,883 casualty records.

- Organized and cleaned the data for consistent analysis in Excel.

- Created PivotTables to analyze casualties by severity, vehicle type, road type, surface, light condition, and location.

- Compared accident trends between 2021 and 2022 on a monthly basis.

- Designed an interactive dashboard using Excel charts, slicers, and filters.

- Added KPI summary cards and visual comparisons for quick insights.

- Created a left-side navigation panel with interactive icons for better user experience.

- Exported the final dashboard as an image for sharing and documentation.

- Summarized key insights to highlight major accident patterns and risk factors.

## Project Insight
This project analyzes detailed road accident data from 2021 and 2022 to uncover critical trends and patterns affecting casualty rates. By examining factors such as location type (urban vs rural), road type, vehicle involvement, time of day, and weather conditions, the analysis highlights key risk areas and periods with the highest accident frequency and severity.

The insights reveal that single carriageway roads and cars are associated with the highest casualties, with November being the most dangerous month. Most accidents happen during daylight on dry roads, and urban areas experience more casualties than rural ones. A slight increase in total casualties in 2022 indicates the need for continued safety measures.

This data-driven understanding can guide policymakers, traffic authorities, and safety organizations to implement targeted interventions and improve road safety outcomes.

## Final Conclusion
The analysis of road accident data from 2021 and 2022 reveals that single carriageway roads and cars are the most common factors in casualty incidents. Urban areas experience higher casualties than rural, with November showing the peak accident month. Most accidents happen during daylight and on dry road surfaces. A slight increase in casualties in 2022 compared to 2021 highlights ongoing safety concerns.

These findings emphasize the need for targeted safety measures focusing on high-risk road types, vehicle categories, and time periods to effectively reduce casualties and improve overall road safety.
